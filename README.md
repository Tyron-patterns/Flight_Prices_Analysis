# Flight_Prices_Analysis
Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and feature engineering on flight price dataset to extract insights and prepare for ML modeling


# ✈️ Flight Prices Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of Indian domestic flights, with a focus on understanding the factors that influence ticket prices.

The workflow includes:
- ✅ Data Cleaning
- 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The final dataset is prepared for both statistical evaluation and potential machine learning applications.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into three separate Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handles duplicates, missing values, format inconsistencies, and data type conversion.
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Derives useful features from raw data (e.g., journey duration in minutes, hour of day).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Uncovers trends and insights using statistics and visualizations.
